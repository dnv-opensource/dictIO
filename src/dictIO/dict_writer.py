        Writes a dictIO dict (parameter source_dict of type SDict) to target_file.
        Following file formats are supported and interpreted through target_file's file ending:
        no file ending   ->   dictIO native dict file
        '.cpp'           ->   dictIO native dict file
        '.foam'          ->   Foam dictionary file
        '.json'          ->   Json dictionary file
        '.xml'           ->   XML file
        Following modes are supported:
        mode = 'a': append to target file. If the existing file contains a dictionary, write() will append the new dict
        to the existing through merging. This is the default behaviour.
        mode = 'w': overwrite target file. The existing file will be overwritten.
