File Format
=================

By default, dictIO reads and writes Python dicts as human-readable ASCII text files in C++ dictionary (cpp) format.
With some limitations, dictIO also supports reading and writing to `OpenFOAM <https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/openfoam-guide-input-types.html>`_, `Json <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_ and `XML <https://www.w3.org/XML/>`_.
