Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
Mapping the basic tree model of XML to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult, especially when XML is used for exchanging highly structured data between applications, which was not its primary design goal.
JSON, YAML, and S-Expressions are frequently proposed as simpler alternatives that focus on representing highly structured data rather than documents, which may contain both highly structured and relatively unstructured content.
